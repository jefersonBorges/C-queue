Sequential queue

Imagine an airport runway and implement software that controls the arrival and departure of these planes.
An airplane is represented by two pieces of information: a code and the airline that owns it.
The software must use a data structure called Queue to implement this control, presenting a menu that allows:

1. the takeoff of an airplane.
2. the arrival of a plane on the runway.
3. information on how many planes are on the runway.
